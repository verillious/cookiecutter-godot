## üèÉ Quickstart

### Generate a Godot project:

Cookiecutter works with python so [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already! (make sure you include pip and add it to your PATH)

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```shell
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Create the project:

```shell
cookiecutter gh:verillious/cookiecutter-godot
```

### Run the tests:

Install [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) if you haven't installed it yet:

```shell
pip install -U tox
```

Run tox:

```shell
tox
```
